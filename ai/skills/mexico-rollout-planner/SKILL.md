# Mexico Rollout Planner

## Data sources

1. **Strategy** — `ai/data/rollout_strategy.md`
   - Groups and their tenant lists
   - Advancement criteria and batch size
   - Exclusions and current active group

2. **Tenant data + execution status** — `ai/data/sheet_data/migration_planer.md`
   - One row per tenant with complexity metrics, `Es demo?` flag, and `Status Mail Migración`
   - Always refreshed at the start of the workflow (see Step 0 below)

---

## Group classification

Tenants are not listed explicitly in the strategy file. Derive group membership from `migration_planer.md` using these rules, applied in order (first match wins):

| Group | Rule |
|-------|------|
| **Group 1 — Demos and test** | `Es demo? = True` |
| **Group 2 — Small tenants** | `Es demo? = False` AND `Total Asignaciones = 0` |
| **Group 3 — Main wave** | `Es demo? = False` AND `Total Asignaciones Anterior al Ingreso = 0` AND (`Total Asignaciones Posterior al Ingreso = 0` OR most assignments are equal-to-entry) |
| **Group 4 — Large / complex** | `Es demo? = False` AND `Total Asignaciones Anterior al Ingreso > 0` (majority of assignments predate company entry) |

> "Most assignments are equal-to-entry" means `Total Asignaciones en el Ingreso` is the largest of the three assignment-type columns.

## Analysis workflow

### Step 0 — Refresh the data

Before any analysis, always fetch the latest sheet data:

```bash
./rollout.sh sheet-data
```

This updates `ai/data/sheet_data/migration_planer.md` with current tenant statuses from the Excel source. Do not skip this step — stale data will produce incorrect batch recommendations.

### Step 1 — Build the status map

From `migration_planer.md`, build a per-tenant summary using the `Status Mail Migración` column. Keep only the **most recent** row per tenant if duplicates exist.

### Step 2 — Classify all tenants into groups

Apply the **Group classification** rules above to every row in `migration_planer.md`. This produces the tenant list for each group.

### Step 3 — Identify the active group

From `rollout_strategy.md`, find the **Active group** in the Current State section.

### Step 4 — Evaluate the active group

For each tenant in the active group:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `success` | Done ✅ |
| `forced` | Done but flag for manual review ⚠️ |
| `failed` | Needs retry or investigation ❌ |
| `desconocido` | Unknown — treat as not run |
| not in status file | Not yet migrated |

Compute:
- **total** = number of tenants in the group
- **done** = tenants with `success` or `forced`
- **failed** = tenants with `failed`
- **pending** = tenants not yet run or `desconocido`
- **success_rate** = done / (done + failed), ignoring pending

### Step 5 — Decide whether to advance

Apply the criteria from `rollout_strategy.md`:

- If `success_rate < threshold` → **do not advance**. Report failures and stop.
- If `failed > 0` → flag them but still check if threshold is met.
- If all tenants in the group are done and criteria met → **advance to next group** and use that group's pending tenants.

### Step 6 — Select the next batch

From the active (or newly advanced) group, pick up to **batch_size** tenants that are still pending (not `success`, not `forced`), excluding any tenants in the Exclusions list.

## Output format

Always respond with this structure:

```
## Rollout recommendation — <date>

**Active group:** Group N — <name>
**Progress:** X / Y tenants complete (Z% success rate)

### ⚠️ Issues  (omit section if none)
- tenant_foo: failed — needs investigation

### ✅ Next batch (<N> tenants)
tenant_a
tenant_b
tenant_c
...

### Reasoning
<One short paragraph explaining why these tenants were selected and whether the group is on track.>
```

---

## Output files

After producing the recommendation, write two files:

### 1. Tenant list — `ai/data/next_batch_tenants.txt`

One tenant slug per line, no extra formatting. This file is consumed directly by migration scripts.

```
tenant_a
tenant_b
tenant_c
```

### 2. PR description — `ai/data/next_batch_pr_description.md`

Markdown suitable for use as a pull request description. Include:

```markdown
## Mexico Vacation Migration — Batch <date>

**Group:** Group N — <name>
**Tenants in this batch:** <N>
**Overall group progress:** X / Y complete (<Z>% success rate)

### Tenants
- `tenant_a`
- `tenant_b`
- `tenant_c`

### Why these tenants
<Same reasoning paragraph from the recommendation. Explain group classification criteria, current progress, and why it is safe to proceed.>

### Issues to watch
<List any failed or forced tenants flagged in the recommendation, or omit this section if none.>
```

## Generate the PR

After writing the two output files, run the migration script to create the branch, commit, and PR automatically:

```bash
python3 generate-rapanui-migration.py \
    -t ai/data/next_batch_tenants.txt \
    -d ai/data/next_batch_pr_description.md
```

The script will:
1. Parse the PR description to extract the migration name, batch date, and group number
2. Create a branch `mutation/migrar-vacaciones-mx-grupo-<N>-<date>` in `~/rapanui-v2`
3. Write the `.rb` and `.yml` mutation files
4. Commit, push, and open the GitHub PR using the PR description file as the body

If the `~/rapanui-v2` repository is in a different location, pass `-r <path>` to the script.

## After output

Suggest updating the **Current State** section in `rollout_strategy.md` with the active group and any observations. Do not update it automatically — ask the user to confirm first.
